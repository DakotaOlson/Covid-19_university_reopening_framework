main.py:
	file you need to run
	line 300 set how many processes you want at a time, 10 is the max on my 6 core 12 thread machine that still allows me to use other applications without lag
	line 333 set how many total runs you want generated
	line 336 set what template file you want
	if code having issue comment line 323 and uncomment 322, prevents running in parallel
	Currently results are only for students or only for professors, networks are combined together regardless
	
airborne.py:
	airborneProb returns the probability using the wells-riley equation
	diffProb returns the probability with the differentiate wells-riley equation
	they take same inputs, only default is pulmonary ventilation rate of 0.48
	
disease_progression.py:
	handle disease progression
	takes different progression rates for the first and second network
	
surface_transfer.py:
	surface infection transfer score model that decays daily, commented out in main currently
	
MeanSE.py
	find means and standard error and exports them to a csv, generates a SEIR graph
	
template.txt:
	simulation gets parameters from this file (or whatever the file input into sim is called). Can add whatever following this format.
	format: "name": number or string
	main takes template and converts to list, so if you add line "Temp: 15" this can be accessed by parameters['Temp']
	
	Output Directory - name of folder you want to generate, simulation will not overwrite a non empty file with same name
	Quant Rate - Quantum production rate for disease
	Vent Rate - Room ventilation rate
	Density - Students per sq ft
	Mask Rate - mask rate for people in the first network
	Mask Efficiency - mask efficiency for people in the first network
	Mask Rate 2 - mask rate for people in the second network
	Mask Efficiency 2 - mask efficiency for people in the second network
	Class Mode - set to 1 if want to do airborne transfer
	Professor Mode - decides if you want results for students (0) or professors (1), sim does find results for both but runs sims for both
	Network - tensor, currently the student tensor
	Courses - CSV for course listing with start times, end times and class sizes
	Other Network - second tensor, currently professor tensor
	Asymptomatic Rate - rate people are symptomatic, got number from included UMN SPH + MN DOH model
	
	# students
	Infectious Death Rate - rate non-hospitalized infectious death for students, got number from included UMN SPH + MN DOH model (based on age ranges)
	Hospitalization Rate - rate of hospitalization for students, got number from included UMN SPH + MN DOH model (based on age ranges)
	Hospitalization Death Rate - rate hospitalized death for students, got number from included UMN SPH + MN DOH model (based on age ranges)
	Breath Rate - rate which students experience shortness of breath (Lancet model)
	Breath Death Rate - just have been using same rate for hospitalized
	Respirator Rate - rate which students get put on respirator (Lancet model)
	Respirator Death Rate - just have been using same rate for icu
	ICU Rate - rate of icu for hospitalized students, got number from included UMN SPH + MN DOH model (based on age ranges)
	ICU Death Rate - rate of icu  death for icu students, got number from included UMN SPH + MN DOH model (based on age ranges)
